        <h2>About Biograghy</h2>
        <p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was a great scientist and the 11th President of India. He was born on 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. He came from a poor family but worked very hard in school and became a top student.

He became a scientist at ISRO and DRDO, where he helped make India’s first satellite launch vehicle (SLV) and worked on missile projects, which earned him the name "Missile Man of India."

He became the President of India in 2002 and was loved by everyone, especially students, because he always encouraged them to dream big and work hard.

Dr. Kalam was kind, humble, and full of knowledge. He wrote many books like Wings of Fire and Ignited Minds. He passed away on 27 July 2015 while giving a speech to students — doing what he loved most.</p>
